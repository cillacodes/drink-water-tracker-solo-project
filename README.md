This is my solo project for Prime Academy. Drink is an application to track daily and weekly water consumption. It integrates a Particle Photon to physically track how much water a user drinks per day.

On the home page, a user can manually add the amount of water they drank.

Any amount manually added on the home page or added from the "smart coaster" gets displayed here.
